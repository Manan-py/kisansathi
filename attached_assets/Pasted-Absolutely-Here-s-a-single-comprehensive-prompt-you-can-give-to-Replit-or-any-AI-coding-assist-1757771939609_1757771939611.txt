Absolutely! Here‚Äôs a **single comprehensive prompt** you can give to Replit (or any AI coding assistant) to **redesign your AgriTech dashboard** and implement the full multilingual + voice-enabled chatbot functionality exactly as you described:

### Complete Prompt for Replit ‚Äî AgriTech Dashboard Redesign + Multilingual Voice Chatbot Feature

````prompt
We are building a responsive AgriTech web app for farmers using React JS (no TypeScript). Please redesign and implement the following features and UX improvements in one go:

---

1. **Dashboard Redesign (Minimal, Modern, Mobile-First)**

- Create a clean, card-based dashboard layout with distinct sections:
  - **Welcome Section:** Display greeting with farmer‚Äôs name, current location, and current weather summary.
  - **News Ticker:** A horizontally sliding ticker that cycles through agricultural news headlines one at a time. Each headline shows a category tag (e.g. üß™ Research, üåæ Crop) and is swipeable or navigable by arrow buttons.
  - **Main Feature Cards:** Four main cards for navigation:
    - Chatbot (‚ÄúTalk to AgriBot ü§ñ‚Äù)
    - Disease Detection (‚ÄúScan your Plant üñºÔ∏è‚Äù)
    - Mandi Price Prediction (‚ÄúMarket Prediction üìà‚Äù)
    - Plant Growth Tracker (‚ÄúSoil & Crop Tips üå±‚Äù)
  
- Add a **sticky top navigation bar** with:
  - App logo/name
  - **Language selector** dropdown (English | ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä | ‡®™‡©∞‡®ú‡®æ‡®¨‡©Ä)
  - Voice input toggle (üé§ Mic On/Off)
  - Profile avatar with dropdown menu (Profile, History, Logout)
  - Theme toggle (light/dark)

- Ensure the UI uses **large fonts, clear icons, and high contrast** suitable for low literacy users on mobile devices.

---

2. **Full Multilingual Support (English, Hindi, Punjabi)**

- Use a JSON-based translation system (e.g., `react-i18next` or simple custom hook).
- All visible text, labels, placeholders, buttons, news headlines, chatbot prompts, and feature content must update dynamically based on the selected language.
- Persist the language choice in `localStorage` so it remains after reload.
- Example translation JSON structure:

```json
{
  "en": { "welcome": "Welcome", "chat": "Chat with AgriBot" },
  "hi": { "welcome": "‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§ó‡§§ ‡§π‡•à", "chat": "‡§è‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§¨‡•ã‡§ü ‡§∏‡•á ‡§¨‡§æ‡§§ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç" },
  "pa": { "welcome": "‡®∏‡©Å‡®Ü‡®ó‡®§ ‡®π‡©à", "chat": "‡®ê‡®ó‡®∞‡©Ä‡®¨‡©ã‡®ü ‡®®‡®æ‡®≤ ‡®ó‡©±‡®≤ ‡®ï‡®∞‡©ã" }
}
````

* Language switch should update the entire UI instantly without page reload, including the chatbot interaction language.

---

3. **Chatbot Page with Voice Input & Voice Output**

* Implement a chatbot interface integrated with Gemini API that supports:

  * **Voice input** using the Web Speech API microphone.
  * Text input fallback.
  * Display user and AI messages in chat bubbles.
  * Show loading indicator while waiting for AI response.

* Once AI response is received:

  * Use Text-to-Speech API to **read the response aloud** in the selected UI language.
  * Provide **play** and **pause** buttons to control voice playback.
  * Automatically switch TTS language to match the current language selection.

* The chatbot should pre-load the user‚Äôs current location as context and send it with every query for localized advice.

* Add a large, easy-to-access microphone button to start/stop voice input.

---

4. **Accessibility & Mobile Usability**

* Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, toggles, cards) are at least 44x44 pixels.
* Use clear icons with alt text.
* Avoid hover-only interactions.
* Use high-contrast colors and readable fonts.
* Test on small mobile screens with vertical scrolling.

---

5. **Tech Stack Requirements**

* React JS (JavaScript only)
* Use FastAPI backend for:

  * Weather data
  * Soil & crop advice
  * Mandi price predictions
* Use Google Translate API or manual JSON files for translations.
* Use Web Speech API for voice input/output.
* Simple modular folder structure:

```
/src
  /components
  /pages
  /translations
  /assets
  App.js
```

---

Please provide clean, modular React component code with comments, following best practices for readability and scalability. Include:

* Dashboard with language toggle and news ticker
* Fully multilingual chatbot with voice input/output and pause/play controls
* Responsive styling suitable for low literacy farmers on mobile devices
* Integration points with FastAPI backend and Gemini API for chat

---

This implementation should enable farmers to seamlessly switch languages, interact with the chatbot via voice/text, receive voice responses, and navigate a modern, minimal dashboard with all relevant agri-features.

Thank you!

If you want, I can also help by generating starter React components or the i18n JSON files for this setup!
