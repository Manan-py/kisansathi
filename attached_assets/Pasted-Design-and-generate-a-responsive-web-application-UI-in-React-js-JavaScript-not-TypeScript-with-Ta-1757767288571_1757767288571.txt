Design and generate a responsive web application UI in React.js (JavaScript, not TypeScript) with Tailwind CSS.  
The app is for farmers and should have a clean, modern, and highly usable UX, optimized for both desktop and mobile.

1. **Dashboard Page**  
   - Farmer profile section with name, location, and soil type.  
   - History/usage data section (simple card layout).  
   - News section: sliding text ticker with agriculture-related news from an API.  

2. **Chatbot Page**  
   - Simple chat UI (like WhatsApp style) with AI avatar.  
   - Input field with support for text and voice.  
   - Messages should appear in chat bubbles, farmerâ€™s messages on the right (green), AI responses on the left (light gray).  

3. **Disease Detection Page**

   - Preview of uploaded image.  
   - Results section: Detected disease + solution displayed in a styled card with icons.

   - Recommendation: Which crop to grow in given soil type.

ðŸ”¹ UI Guidelines:  
- Use **cards with rounded corners, soft shadows, and padding** for each section.  
- Typography: Clear, large headings (farmers may have low literacy).  
- Icons: Use relevant icons (weather, crops, soil, chatbot, etc).  
- Keep navigation simple: top or side navbar with icons + text (Dashboard, Chatbot, Disease Detection, Mandi Prices, Growth Tracker).  
- Include a floating action button for **voice assistant** on every page (mic icon, red #F55F55).  
- Multilingual toggle (English, Hindi, Punjabi) at the top-right corner.  
- Responsive design: stack sections vertically on mobile.  

Output clean **React.js components** with Tailwind classes, one file per page. Avoid over-complicated structure.
